# Bust the Ghost â€” Bayesian Inference Game

An AI-powered interactive game built in Python that demonstrates **Bayesian inference** for uncertainty reasoning.  
Developed as part of **CSC 4301: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2024)**.

---

##  Game Overview
- The game board is an **8Ã—13 grid**.  
- A ghost hides randomly in one of the cells.  
- The player tries to find it by clicking cells and interpreting sensor clues.  
- The goal: **Bust the ghost before score or attempts run out!**

---

## Game Rules
- **Starting score**: 50 points.  
- **Bust attempts**: 2.  
- **Color hints (distance sensor)**:
  - ðŸ”´ Red â†’ Ghost is here  
  - ðŸŸ  Orange â†’ 1â€“2 cells away  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow â†’ 3â€“4 cells away  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green â†’ 5+ cells away  
- **Direction hints (direction sensor)**:
  - Provides noisy estimates of the ghostâ€™s direction relative to the clicked cell.  

**Winning:** Bust the correct cell containing the ghost.  
**Losing:** Run out of score or bust attempts.

## Implementation
The project is structured into 4 main Python files:

- `config.py` â€” game constants and conditional probability tables.  
- `gui.py` â€” Tkinter-based graphical interface.  
- `game_logic.py` â€” Bayesian inference, ghost placement, probability updates, and core rules.  
- `main.py` â€” main game loop, integrates GUI and logic.  

**Key Features**
- Bayesian inference updates ghost location probabilities after every sensor reading.  
- Probability view toggle â€” display posterior probabilities directly on the grid.  
- Direction sensor toggle â€” combine distance + direction evidence for refined inference.

##  AI Concepts
- **Bayesian Inference** for updating beliefs about the ghostâ€™s location.  
- **Conditional Probability Tables** for sensor reliability.  
- **Evidence Fusion** â€” combining distance and direction evidence.
